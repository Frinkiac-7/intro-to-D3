## What is D3?

[https://d3js.org/](https://d3js.org/)
D3 (Data Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data.


A lot of the work that I've done is dashboards and data visualization



The gold standard is d3

d3 is super complex. It's less a charting library, and more a method of data
visualization

Has it's own dom manipulation built in.




## A wide variety of applications
